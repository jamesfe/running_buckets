# Notes, 15 Juillet 2017

I "finished" the slider insofar as its functionality is working.  It's ugly.  Visually, I have some styling that needs to be done - overall, this visualization needs a *theme* or something by which to define it, otherwise it's just another graph that looks just like my `reddit_stats` graphs.  Also, maybe I've done something a little naughty: when I load the data from XML, I immediately assign it to `window.data` which seems a little kludgy.

In general though, I'm happy that I learned to do the slider and to make a visualization interactive.  We have more work to do, including other TODOs from previous notes.  I summarize below:

## TODO

 [X] Slider basic functionality
 [X] Slider beautification
 [ ] Unit Tests
 [ ] Share graphics
 [ ] Include HR and Elevation data
 [ ] Dynamic histogram bounds based on data


## More work from Saturday

[https://css-tricks.com/styling-cross-browser-compatible-range-inputs-css/] for CSS styling - I essentially just nabbed this and removed everything but Chrome since I'm not terribly interested in x-browser right now.

But on my bigger to-do list I should invest some time in reading and looking up various CSS descriptors.
