## Thoughts

Nothing terribly profound today except the natural realization that it is time to pause the addition of functionality in light of the need for better "dev hygiene", a new term I will use to describe unit tests, integration tests and linting.

Maybe if I'd started with this stuff I would be farther but I don't regret it terribly - unit tests are an investment in the project, so maybe now that I know it's worthwhile enough I will do them.

## To Do

After this, I need to work on the slider.  That was one of the initial goals of this project.

Otherwise, I need to integrate the other bits of data but those I would prefer to do a little more legwork on to make something truly beautiful.

Also, I should share my graphs and ask for feedback but I am unsure of a good forum for this.

Finally, I will celebrate the fact that I have written some solid unit tests.
