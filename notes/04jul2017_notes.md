I am now finding a new problem which is unique to this business logic: what if I stood still during a race?  Well, it turns out that when you run 50 miles, this happens.  There are rest stops along the way.

My solution to this is simply to make the distance moved 10cm.  This is probably not a good thing to do: in reality what I should do is combine this point with the following point, then calculate the segmentation as usual. 

I'll code up the first, then fix with the second way when I have more time and a working graph.
