## Happy 14 Juillet!

## Making the Slider

This is the first interactivity my visualization will have so I am doing a little bit of stumbling.  Let's see how this goes.

I am looking at using this [https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/847677] as an example.

Here are is the layout I think I'll need:
- Detect changes in the slider
- Recalculate the graph
- Render changes in the graph
